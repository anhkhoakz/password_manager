# Password and Passphrase Generator

This program generates random passwords and passphrases in Python.

## Description

This program uses the EFF wordlist to generate random passphrases. The EFF wordlist is a list of 77,767 words that are commonly used in English. This makes it a good choice for generating passphrases that are both strong and memorable.

The program also includes a function for generating random passwords. The password generator uses a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters to create passwords that are difficult to crack.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* requests
